<h4> Project SLIDE: Suspected Landslide IDentification Environment </h4>

This is the official repository for team Earth Alert at the Huntsville Space Apps Challenge 2017. We are competing in the Warning! Danger Ahead! category
on the When Landslides Strike challenge. Our goal is to save lives through the power of community contributions. Our approach utilizes the existing NASA-create
Global Landslide Nowcast to warn users if they are in an area at a high risk of landslides. This model was created from the Global Landslide Catalog and 
takes into account real time measurements of precipitation. We notify users to our website if they are in a danger area (if they agree to provide us with their location)
and we are working to incorporate text message warnings as well. The long term goal of our application is to have a service such as severe weather alerts
that would be able to send SMS messages to all individuals with a phone (not necessarily a smartphone) in an at-risk area. Our service will also allow
for users to enter their own data and pictures in order to improve the model. This data will also be provided to emergency responders so they know what to 
expect on the ground.
