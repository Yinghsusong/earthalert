# Earth Alert

This is the official repository for team Earth Alert at the Huntsville Space Apps Challenge 2017. We are competing in the Warning! Danger Ahead! category on the **When Landslides Strike** challenge. 

Our approach uses the existing NASA-created **Global Landslide Nowcast** to warn users if they are in an area at a high risk of landslides. This model was created from the Global Landslide Catalog and takes into account real time measurements of precipitation. We notify users to our website if they are in a danger area through the site itself and through text message. Our service will also allow users to enter their own data and pictures in order to improve the model.

Users can interact with the service through SMS (in areas that have no reliable internet connection) or the site itself, and receive tailored information that incorporates both the Landslide Nowcast information and economic data to predict landslide activity.
