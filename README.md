# Earth Alert

This is the official repository for team Earth Alert at the Huntsville Space Apps Challenge 2017. We are competing in the Warning! Danger Ahead! category on the **When Landslides Strike** challenge. Our goal is to save lives through the power of community contributions. Our approach utilizes the existing NASA-created Global Landslide Nowcast to warn users if they are in an area at a high risk of landslides. This model was created from the Global Landslide Catalog and takes into account real time measurements of precipitation. We notify users to our website if they are in a danger area through the site itself and through text message. Our service will also allow users to enter their own data and pictures in order to improve the model.
